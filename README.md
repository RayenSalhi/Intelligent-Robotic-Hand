## 📡 Key Features

### 🎥 Camera-Based Gesture Control  
- Tracks real human hand movements in real time.  
- Uses computer vision to extract gesture positions and send commands to the robotic hand.

### ⚙️ STM32 Microcontroller  
- Powered by the **STM32H7A3ZI** MCU.  
- Responsible for precise servo control and movement synchronization.

### 🐍 Python Integration  
- Python handles image processing and gesture recognition.  
- Sends motion commands to the STM32 via serial communication.

### 🦾 3D Mechanical Design  
- All mechanical parts designed in **Fusion 360**.  
- Fully 3D printable structure, customizable and modular.

### 🔌 Electronics  
- **Servo motors** drive the hand's fingers.  
- Designed for smooth and responsive actuation.
